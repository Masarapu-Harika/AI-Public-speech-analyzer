# Simple WAV-Only Version

If you want to avoid FFmpeg complications entirely, you can:

1. **Update the allowed extensions in app.py:**
   ```python
   ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'wav'}
   ```

2. **Update the error message:**
   ```python
   return jsonify({'error': 'Please upload WAV files only. Convert MP3 to WAV first.'}), 400
   ```

3. **Convert your MP3 files to WAV using any of the methods above**

This approach is simpler and avoids dependency issues entirely.
